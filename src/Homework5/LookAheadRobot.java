/**
 *NEW HW3 REQUIIREMENT: The LookAheadRobot Class
 * A LookAheadRobot has both a location and a direction which it is facing. A LookAheadRobotâ€™s goal is to
 * search for the exit while always trying to recursively move as far as it can in one direction. On a move, it goes in
 * the same direction until it cannot go any further. When planning its move direction, it will try to choose to go
 * straight. If it cannot go straight, it will try to turn right. If it cannot turn right, it will try to turn left. As a last resort,
 * it will turn around. Once the robot moves as far as it can in certain direction, its move is finished, and it stays facing
 * in that direction. This kind of robot always needs to know the direction it is currently facing before it can decide
 * which move to try first. It also inherits from the FacingRobot.
 *
 * NOTE:  To "move as far as it can in one direction" as requested won't work in the bigger maze.
 * This is because the bot needs to know when it crosses a path that it should consider a different move.
 * Currently, if the robot hits a pocket dead end and the result of moving the opposite direction
 * ends in a pocket dead end the robot is stuck in.  I altered the code to read
 * or listen for a location based upon the bots current location.  Assume we have a left, right, and straight
 * direction.  If 2 or more of them are open, the bot should stop it's move and chooseMoveDirection again.
